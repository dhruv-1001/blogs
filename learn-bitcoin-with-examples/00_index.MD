# Learn Bitcoin with examples

## Introduction
This blog series aims to help individuals understand Bitcoin with examples. In these blogs we will go through how Bitcoin works along with some hands-on examples and practice that you can do to have a great understanding.

If you are like me, you like to have some examples with the theory, and you would like to know what is going on under the hood and look at the data, and what does that data mean. These blogs will help you understand how this all works.

These blogs will also help me with documenting what I have learned until now about Bitcoin.

## Why Bitcoin?
I would say this is more important for someone to understand why they should invest their time in Bitcoin, and how Bitcoin solves money.

This video [BTC001: Bitcoin Common Misconceptions W/ Robert Breedlove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVpVcOwh2Og) explains what money is, and what Bitcoin is trying to solve. This video also covers some misconceptions about Bitcoin.

I highly recommend for all to listen to this podcast and have some idea on why to invest your time and develop Bitcoin.

## Content
There is too much to learn about Bitcoin, that cannot be covered by blogs. So we will start with the most basic stuff that you need to know to understand on how Bitcoin works, and after that I will be writing blogs and adding their links to this blog about specific things I learn about Bitcoin, and what projects I will be contributing to.

We will be working from the ground up, and going the basic concepts using some data examples, and solving some exercises. I'll be adding links to the blogs as I complete them.
